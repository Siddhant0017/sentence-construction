# Sentence Construction Exercise
A React-based interactive language learning application that helps users improve their sentence construction skills through engaging exercises.

## Overview
The Sentence Construction Exercise is designed to enhance language proficiency by challenging users to arrange words in the correct order to form meaningful sentences. The application presents users with incomplete sentences containing blanks, and a set of word options to fill those blanks in the correct sequence.

## Features
- Interactive UI : Clean, modern interface with intuitive controls
- Timed Exercises : Each question has a 60-second timer to encourage quick thinking
- Progress Tracking : Visual progress bar shows advancement through the exercise
- Immediate Feedback : See your score and review your answers after completion
- Detailed Results : Review your performance with a breakdown of each question
- Responsive Design : Works seamlessly across different screen sizes
## Technology Stack
- React : Frontend library for building the user interface
- TailwindCSS : Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- Lucide React : Icon library for UI elements
- JavaScript ES6+ : Modern JavaScript features for clean code
## How It Works
1. Start Page : Users begin at a welcome screen with exercise information
2. Question Interface : Each question displays an incomplete sentence with blanks
3. Word Selection : Users select words from available options to fill the blanks
4. Time Management : A 30-second timer for each question encourages efficiency
5. Automatic Progression : When time expires or all blanks are filled, the app advances to the next question
6. Results Page : After completing all questions, users see their overall score and can review each answer
## Project Structure
The application is organized into modular components:

- DataService : Handles fetching question data from external sources
- Timer : Manages countdown functionality for each question
- StartPage : Displays welcome screen with exercise information
- ScoreCard : Shows detailed results after exercise completion
- SentenceExercise : Main component orchestrating the exercise flow
